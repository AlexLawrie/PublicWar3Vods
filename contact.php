How to use the Search Bar
</b></h1></p>
<p>
The search bar can be used to search for multiple things.  These include races (search human) for all human games, heroes (search keeper, priestess, and archmage etc), and maps (search echo isles).  Hero names use their short name and maps use their full name.
